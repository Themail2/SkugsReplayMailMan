# Skullgirls Replay Mail Man
This client application store replays created while playing SkullGirls on our servers for sharing and storage purposes. See README for more information.

# How to set up the client
Setting up the client is simple. Just place the .exe within your steam\steamapps\common\Skullgirls directory and run it. For first time run, you will need to provide the client with the folder path that your replays are stored in. From then on, please use the client to launch Skullgirls.

# Using the client
All you need to do is double click the .exe, you can also add it as a game on steam and launch it directly from steam. That's it!

# Grabbing your replays
Head over to our website *in progress* to grab and download stored replays. This is great for sharing replays with your friends!
